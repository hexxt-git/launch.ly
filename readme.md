# üöÄ launch.ly

**launch.ly** is an AI-native application that transforms a single startup idea into a fully refined concept with an actionable execution plan. It uses a sophisticated, two-stage multi-agent system to simulate a team of expert collaborators, guided by human interaction.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **AI-Powered Idea Refinement:** Leverages a "Refinement Council" of specialized AI agents to analyze an idea from every critical angle (marketing, legal, technical, etc.).
* **Live Collaboration Showcase:** A real-time streaming UI that visualizes the agent collaboration, showing which agent is "thinking" and displaying their insights as they are generated.
* **Structured Reporting:** A final, clean summary report is generated for user review, synthesizing the entire collaboration into actionable insights.
* **Human-in-the-Loop Approval:** The user acts as the CEO, giving the final "go" or "no-go" on the refined concept before any execution planning begins.
* **Type-Safe Full-Stack:** Built on a modern, fully type-safe stack from the database to the UI.
