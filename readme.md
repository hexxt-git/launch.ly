# üöÄ launch.ly

**launch.ly** is an AI-native application that transforms a single startup idea into a fully refined concept with an actionable execution plan. It uses a sophisticated, two-stage multi-agent system to simulate a team of expert collaborators, guided by human interaction.

## ‚ú® Core Features

* **AI-Powered Idea Refinement:** Leverages a "Refinement Council" of specialized AI agents to analyze an idea from every critical angle (marketing, legal, technical, etc.).
* **Live Collaboration Showcase:** A real-time streaming UI that visualizes the agent collaboration, showing which agent is "thinking" and displaying their insights as they are generated.
* **Structured Reporting:** A final, clean summary report is generated for user review, synthesizing the entire collaboration into actionable insights.
* **Human-in-the-Loop Approval:** The user acts as the CEO, giving the final "go" or "no-go" on the refined concept before any execution planning begins.
* **Type-Safe Full-Stack:** Built on a modern, fully type-safe stack from the database to the UI.

## üß† The Agentic Architecture

The core of launch.ly is a two-team agent system, with a critical human interaction point acting as a gate between them.

### Team 1: The Refinement Council

This is the initial "think tank." Its goal is to take a raw idea and forge it into a viable concept.

                           |   User's Idea   |
                           +-----------------+
                                   |

                        |--------------------|
                        |   - Marketing      |
                        |   - Brand          |
                        |   - Software       |
                        |   - Law            |
                        +--------------------+
                                   |
                                   V
                          +----------------+
                          | Summary Agent  |
                          +----------------+
                                   |
                                   V


### The Human Interaction Gate
This is the most important step. The system does not proceed automatically.


                           +-----------------+
                           |  Final Report   |
                           +-----------------+
                                   |

+--------------------------------------V--------------------------------------+
|                                                                             |
|                      Does the User Accept the Report?                       |
|                                                                             |
+--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------+
| (Yes)                                  | (No)
V                                        V
+-------------------+                          +----------+
| Proceed to Team 2 |                          |   End    |
+-------------------+                          +----------+


### Team 2: The Execution Crew

Once the user grants approval, the refined concept is handed off to a new team of agents focused on action.


    +-------------------+
    |  Accepted Report  |
    +-------------------+
              |
              V
    +-------------------+
    |   Planner Agent   |  (Creates a structured JSON plan)
    +-------------------+
              |
              V
    +--------------------+
    |  Execution Graph   |
    |--------------------|
    | - Marketing Executor (uses video/post tools) |
    | - Sales Executor (uses lead-gen tools)       |
    | - Calendar Agent (uses scheduling tools)     |
    +--------------------+
              |
              V
    +---------------------+
    |  Actionable Output  |
    | (Calendar Events,   |
    |  Ad Scripts, etc.)  |
    +---------------------+
